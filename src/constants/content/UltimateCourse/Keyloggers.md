# Keyloggers
Raw Content: 

Keyloggers attempt to capture a user's keystrokes. The keystrokes are stored in a file and either sent to an attaacker immediately, or saved until the attacker retrieves the file. While a keylogger is typically software, it can also be hardware. For example, you can purchase a USB keylogger, plug it into the computer, and plug the keyboard into the USB keylogger. This hardware keylogger will record all keystrokes and store them within memory on the USB device.

Keyloggers are malware attacks that monitor and record a userâ€™s keystrokes. While keyloggers are usually software-based, hardware, such as a USB keylogger, is also an option. Recorded keystrokes are typically stored in a file that is then sent to the attacker.
