# Keyloggers

Keyloggers attempt to record a user's keystrokes. The keystrokes are stored in a file that is later sent to an attacker. While a keylogger is typically software, it can also be hardware. For example, you can purchase a USB keylogger, plug it into the computer, and plug the keyboard into the USB keylogger. This hardware keylogger will record all keystrokes and store them within memory on the USB device. 

## How To Prevent Keyloggers
One of the ways keyloggers can be thwarted is by using two-factor authentication (2FA), such as text messages sent to a phone. Even if the attackers were able to capture a user's password through keylogging methods, they wouldn't have access to the text message sent to the phone.
