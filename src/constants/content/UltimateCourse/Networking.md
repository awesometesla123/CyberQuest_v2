# **What is *Networking*?**
On a basic level, networking is the practice of connecting devices to allow them to access information and data. Some key concepts in networking involve protocols and services, security, and IP Addresses. 

## **Why is learning about networking important?**
In the modern day, with the increasing reliance on digital communication, cybersecurity and knowledge about networking concepts have never been more important. In this chapter, you will understand the fundamentals of networking. These lessons will empower you to protect your data as you will understand packets; the basics of Internet Protocol; routers, switches, and hubs; the basics of command lines; and some basic networking attacks. 

### **What are packets?**
Packets are the fundamental pieces of data in networking. They are smaller pieces of information that are part of a larger data stream. On a basic level, all packets contain headers and payloads that allow them to get routed around a network efficiently. The header of a packet contains information like source and destination IP addresses. The payload contains the actual information that needs to be sent. Packets are reassembled at their destination points and the data is extracted.

### **Routers in networking:**
This is best explained through an analogy. Imagine routers as traffic cops for the internet! They help guide packets (like cars) as they travels between different networks (neighborhoods). They look at special addresses called IP addresses to decide where data should go. Routers also help homes share one internet connection and make sure it's safe.

### **Purpose of routers in cybersecurity:**
When it comes to cybersecurity, we donâ€™t think too much of routers. However, routers are like the security guards for your home network. They make sure only the right people get in and stop bad guys. They also keep an eye out for any sneaky tricks (intrusions) and lock the doors tight with special codes (VPNs). If anything strange happens, routers tell you by keeping a record (logging) of what's going on. So, routers help keep your online world safe!
