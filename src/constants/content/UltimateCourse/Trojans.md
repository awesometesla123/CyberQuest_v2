# Trojans 

A Trojan, also called a Trojan horse, appears to be something beneficial, but it's actually something malicious. 

## The Story Behind the Name
There is actually a fair amount of lore behind the name "Trojan". Thousands of years ago, there was a war between the Greeks and Trojans. The Greek army consistently tried to break into the city of Troy for years. However, there was minimal success. One Greek soldier eventually came up with the idea of building a massive wooden horse and fooling Troy into thinking it was a peace/surrender offer. The Trojans, completely fooled, brought the horse inside the city and celebrated the victory. 

Inside the horse, however, were Greek warriors. As the party died and people eventually slept, the Greek warriors snuck out of the Trojan and opened the city gates to let the rest of the Greek army in. The Greek army then quickly captured the rest of the city.
