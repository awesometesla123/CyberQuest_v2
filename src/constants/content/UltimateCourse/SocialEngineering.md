## **What is *phishing*?**
Phishing is a cybercrime in which targets are contacted by email, phone, or text message by a malicious group or individual, often posing as a legitimate institution. These attacks have been very frequent recently, and the chances are multiple people you know have received these messages/emails. Here's an example: <br />

<Code language = "javascript">
    ‚ÄúHey, this is Jay, it‚Äôs been so long since we last met! How does a meetup tomorrow night sound?‚Äù
    "Hey, I just found this amazing video! You have to check it out ASAP. Click this link to download: bit.ly/2wxHxqK"
</Code>

### **What are some features of *phishing*?**
Phishing messages are often too good to be true, create a sense of urgency, contain hyperlinks, contain attachments, or are sent by unusual senders. A phishing message does NOT have to have all of these features. Practice this concept by determining which phishing features are present in the following examples: 

<Code language = "javascript">
    ‚ÄúHi Baby, how are you doing? I have a million dollars! Wanna have lunch? üòò‚Äù (Too good to be true, most probably sent by an unusual sender)
    "You're in big trouble! Open this file right now or face serious consequences! Download and run this: ImportantDocument.exe" (Sense of urgency, contains an attachment, and most probably sent by an unusual sender)
</Code>

Note: 
Financial hooks and other attention-grabbing information can lure potential victims in. Remember, there is no free lunch.
